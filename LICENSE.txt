   3. LIMITED WARRANTY.  Sun warrants to you that for
   a period of ninety (90) days from the date of
   purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt,
   the media on which Software is furnished (if any)
   will be free of defects in materials and
   workmanship under normal use.  Except for the
   foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".  Your
   exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under
   this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to
   replace Software media or refund the fee paid for
   Software.

   REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT
   OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE
   SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
   POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will
   Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort
   (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the
   amount paid by you for Software under this
   Agreement.  The foregoing limitations will apply
   even if the above stated warranty fails of its
   essential purpose.

   6.  Termination.  This Agreement is effective
   until terminated.  You may terminate this
   Agreement at any time by destroying all copies of

   and regulations and acknowledge that you have the
   responsibility to obtain such licenses to export,
   re-export, or import as may be required after

   rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

   10.  Severability. If any provision of this
   Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
   Agreement will remain in effect with the provision
   omitted, unless omission would frustrate the
   intent of the parties, in which case this
   Agreement will immediately terminate.

   11.  Integration.  This Agreement is the entire
   agreement between you and Sun relating to its
   subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or
   contemporaneous oral or written communications,

               SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS

   These supplemental license terms ("Supplemental
   Terms") add to or modify the terms of the Binary
   Code License Agreement (collectively, the
   "Agreement"). Capitalized terms not defined in
   these Supplemental Terms shall have the same
   meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. These
   Supplemental Terms shall supersede any
   inconsistent or conflicting terms in the
   Agreement, or in any license contained within the
   Software.

   1. Software Internal Use and Development License
   Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
   Agreement, including, but not limited to Section 3
   (Java(TM) Technology Restrictions) of these
   Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a
   non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license
   to reproduce internally and use internally the
   binary form of the Software, complete and
   unmodified, for the sole purpose of designing,
   developing and testing your Java applets and
   applications ("Programs").

   2. License to Distribute Software.  In addition to
   the license granted in Section 1 (Software
   Internal Use and Development License Grant) of
   these Supplemental Terms, subject to the terms and
   conditions of this Agreement, including but not
   limited to Section 3 (Java Technology
   Restrictions), Sun grants you a non-exclusive,
   non-transferable, limited license to reproduce and
   distribute the Software in binary form only,

   of your Programs, (ii) do not distribute
   additional software intended to replace any
   component(s) of the Software, (iii) do not remove
   or alter any proprietary legends or notices
   contained in the Software, (iv) only distribute
   the Software subject to a license agreement that
   protects Sun's interests consistent with the terms
   contained in this Agreement, and (v) agree to
   defend and indemnify Sun and its licensors from
   and against any damages, costs, liabilities,
   settlement amounts and/or expenses (including

   claim, lawsuit or action by any third party that
   arises or results from the use or distribution of
   any and all Programs and/or Software.

   3. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not
   modify the Java Platform Interface ("JPI",
   identified as classes contained within the "java"
   package or any subpackages of the "java" package),
   by creating additional classes within the JPI or
   otherwise causing the addition to or modification
   of the classes in the JPI.  In the event that you
   create an additional class and associated API(s)
   which (i) extends the functionality of the Java
   Platform, and (ii) is exposed to third party
   software developers for the purpose of developing
   additional software which invokes such additional
   API, you must promptly publish broadly an accurate
   specification for such API for free use by all
   developers. You may not create, or authorize your
   licensees to create additional classes,
   interfaces, or subpackages that are in any way
   identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar
   convention as specified by Sun in any naming
   convention designation.

   4. Trademarks and Logos. You acknowledge and agree
   as between you and Sun that Sun owns the SUN,
   SOLARIS, JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and iPLANET trademarks
   and all SUN, SOLARIS, JAVA, JINI, FORTE, and
   iPLANET-related trademarks, service marks, logos
   and other brand designations ("Sun Marks"), and
   you agree to comply with the Sun Trademark and
   Logo Usage Requirements currently located at

   pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  Source
   code may not be redistributed unless expressly
   provided for in this Agreement.

   6.  Termination for Infringement.  Either party
   may terminate this Agreement immediately should
   any Software become, or in either party's opinion
   be likely to become, the subject of a claim of
   infringement of any intellectual property right.
